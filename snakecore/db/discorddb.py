This file implements a 'DiscordDB', which loads data from a channel on discord,
stores it in memory and finally flushes data back to the channel when the bot
is shutting down.
Some pros of this implemenation are:
1) Database is fast because of data stored in memory
2) No dependence on external SQL API or any database server
Some cons:
1) May have a large memory footprint for large data
2) For now, only one instance of the bot is allowed to run a discorddb channel
